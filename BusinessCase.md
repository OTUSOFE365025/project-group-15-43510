# Business Case   
The current university systems in place are very disconnected and inefficient at relaying information outward.  
Communication is mostly done through LMS, Emails and Web portals which can be very time consuming for quick questions and great concerns.
A fix to this problem would be the implementation of an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Plateform (AIDAP).  
AIDAP fixes this problem by giving users an unified, quick and interactive interface by leveraging the power of AI.  
By Using an AIDAP we can query results using natural human language and have direct answers to our querys through voice and text.
With integrating our AIDAP to existing Univerisity systems in place we can streamline access to courses, grades, deadlines, schedules and announcement allowing everyone in the university to save time and energy,
The plateform architecture insures that the system will be scalable, highly avaliable and reliable allowing it to reach thousands of students while mainting its security and functionality.
